# Realtime Web Interaction Examples

## Example 1: Providing feedback to somebody who is being too 'salesy'

## Example 2: Being able to ask questions

TODO: Add UI example. For the moment this ASP.NET MVC application just allows 'too salesy' notifications to be sent and 'questions to be published'.
It does not have a UI which show the results of these events being triggered. They are actually used within a presentation that I'm
doing on 'Why the realtime web matters'.
